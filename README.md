# Surgical-Skills-Assessment-Using-Multi-Class-Detection-of-Laparoscopic-Instruments-in-IBTS
For certain surgical procedures, Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has become more advantageous than traditional open surgery. Therefore, mastery of laparoscopic skills is an essential component of surgical training and requires considerable time and effort. To guarantee that the use of laparoscopic surgical training methods results in the mastery of essential surgical skills, it is necessary to assess surgeonsâ€™ skills during Intelligent Box-Trainer System (IBTS) training by an expert which is time-consuming and not cost-effective. To solve these problems and prevent any human intervention, a high level of surgical skill assessment like an autonomous skill assessment system is essential. Using an autonomous assessment approach will open up more time for residents to practice without requiring the presence of a supervisor surgeon. This will also free up the supervisor surgeon to carry out other duties.
